This repository contains files used to create a functional mock-up database for an Airport. It defines common airport objects as classes with appropriate attributes and fields, as well as their relationships through foreign keys. 

The source code includes files which may be needed to be ran as MySQL rather than SQL if required but all queries should be ran in the following order: 
- airport_init_setup.sql
- airport_insert_data.sql

- airport_test_drop.sql includes queries only for viewing all data or dropping the entire database.

The project was completed by a team of four members as listed within the final documentation.
